Description
For this assignment you will write a program that will simulate the working of the popular instant messaging service WhatsApp. Your simulation of this service will cover the most basic parts of it like one to one messaging and broadcasts. The run of this simulation will be console based. The model will have users and messages. Each user has her identification in the form of name, password and a unique nickname. Each message has a 'from user', 'to user', the message, sent time, etc. Every user maintains a list of her friends whom she can contact. She also can have a list of broadcast lists. Each broadcast list enlists a set of friends whom she can broadcast messages to. If you have noticed, the list of broadcast lists is a nested list structure. We will also implement the facility for the user to add more friends to her contact list from the global contact list. She can remove friends too. Also, she should be able to create new broadcast lists and add friends to the new list. She will be able to modify existing lists by adding/removing friends. She can delete entire lists too! All this will be accomplished from the console using commands. We will pre-populate the global contact list. Also, a few chat conversations will be populated. A few users will have broadcast lists too. This is to help you get started fast.
For this programming assignment you won't be building an abstract data type (ADT) from scratch. Instead, you'll use Java's ArrayList class to implement the classes as specified below.
