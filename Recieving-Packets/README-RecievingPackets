Description

Computer networks are integral to all aspects of our lives. We routinely use these networks without givng a second thought to how a web of interconnected machines successfully conveys our information and that of millions of others. For this assignment, we'll explore how computer networks ensure successful data transmission. Specifically, this program will simulate the transmission of an image over a computer network. You'll be coding the receiver that gets information packets from a simulated network and reconstructs an image file. We've already coded the sender and network simulator.

To transmit an image file, it is divided into numerous small data packets that are sent across the network. The reality is that networks are complicated and not very reliable. Packets might be corrupted, lost or duplicated, and if that wasn't enough, they arrive at the receiver out of order! To address this, a sequence number is given to each packet. This simple approach can be used to determine if there are any missing or duplicate packets, and also to arrange the received packets in the correct order to properly reconstruct the file.

As the receiver, your job is to collect all these packets, remove duplicates, request any that are missing, replace any that are corrupted, and put them in order by sequence number so that the image can be opened without errors. For missing or corrupted packets, you'll need to request retransmission. The packets will be stored in a singly-linked list with each node storing one packet. If you've done your job well, you will have reconstructed the entire file as a complete and properly sequenced chain of packets so that it can be opened by our image displayer for you to see the picture. The following figure illustrates this process.
